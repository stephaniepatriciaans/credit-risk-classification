Credit Risk Analysis Report: Detailed Summary

A. Objective of the Analysis:
The primary objective of this analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of a proposed credit model in predicting healthy loans ('0') and high-risk loans ('1').

B. Results from the Machine Learning Model:

Initial Model:

For '0' (healthy loans): The initial model exhibited exceptional accuracy with a perfect f1-score of 1.00. Both precision and recall were 99%. The total instances correctly predicted as healthy loans were 18,719.
For '1' (high-risk loans): The model showed good accuracy with an f1-score of 0.88, indicating 85% recall and 91% precision. In this case, 85% of actual high-risk loans were correctly identified out of the total 665 instances.
Model with Resampled Data:

To address the class imbalance issue, the RandomOverSampler method was applied, leading to significant improvements in the model's performance.
For '0' loans: The precision remained high at 1.00, with a recall of 91% and an f1-score of 0.95. The model accurately identified 55,811 healthy loans.
For '1' loans: The precision was 90%, and recall improved to 99%, resulting in an f1-score of 0.95. The model correctly predicted 51,131 high-risk loans out of 51,665 instances.
C. Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis and substantial improvements observed after addressing class imbalance, I recommend advancing this model for further testing in a pilot program. The resampled data demonstrated exceptional accuracy, with both healthy and high-risk loans being predicted reliably. It is advisable to conduct thorough validation in real-world scenarios to ensure consistent and robust results. Once verified, the model can be confidently considered for implementation in live credit risk assessment processes.
